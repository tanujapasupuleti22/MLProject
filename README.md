Human Activity Recongntion using smart phone

Abstract—Physicians suggest exercise is health. Research
suggests that genetics, environment and physical activity are
the 3 factors that contribute more to the health of the person.
Since we can not control the genetics of the person.The second
most factor is physical activity. In the medical industry accurate
data of physical activity of patients help to diagnose and predict
potential diseases and this also helps to track the progress of
the diagnosed patients. Data in this type of situations are high
dimensional(more than 500) in our case we have 561 columns
or independent parameters. A simple user friendly techniques
will improve the usage. This can be achieved through machine
learning dimensional reduction techniques.Human activity recognition(HAR) is a process of monitoring physical activities through
computer aided devices or technology.This technology helps the
people in the medical industry to understand the patient’s daily
physical activities.For conducting experimental analysis ..In this
paper we are proposing the HAR(human activity recognition)
model through machine learning methods Logistic regression,
Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine algorithms are used
to monitor 6 ADLs(Activities of Daily Living) of patients namely
walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing,
laying.This model takes the input of axial linear acceleration
and axial angular velocity parameters which are recorded from
sensors.With this information a csv(Comma seperated Value)
dataset is formed. PCA(Principal Component Analysis) and
various machine learning classification algorithms are used and
compared. PCA is used for dimensionality reduction. Dataset is
collected from UCI machine learning repository.
